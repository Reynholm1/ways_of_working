# About me - a user manual, a way of working. 
_*As we all are, it is a work in progress_

## Why I do what I do
* helping people around me and being valued or respected for what I do.
* to improve by learning something new
* to solve problems.

## What I need to work
* coffee
* snacks
* food, but not too much - after lunch I'm slow.

## Conditions I like to work in 
* I usually work with movie soundtracks or non-lyrical songs
* I like a colder office space.
* not silence.

## Best Ways to Communicate
* I find in person conversations the best, and can rarely get my sentiment across via long form text. 
* emails are not ideal for me
* slack instant messages are far more likely to reach me.
* I batch my comms together a few times a day - please don't think I'm ignoring you if I don't respond instantly.

## How I work
* I use toggl to track my time.
* I like to work flexibly, using mulitple workspaces including home, garden, coffee shop.
* when possible, I like to walk when listening into non-visual meetings.
* Pomodoro Technique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

## How I give and receive feedback
* I find regular feedback helpful, when I'm finishing a bit of work, please let me know how I've done on it - no matter how small.
* I'm internally more negative, but am working on this. Please do provide me with constructive feedback.
* The more specific the feedback the better.
* I like to provide positive feedback in public wherever possible. 
* When I provide feedback - I always try to provide constructive feedback with a desired outcome.

## How I learn
* I learn by asking questions - no matter how basic.
* Video tutorials, I find *just* reading a bit dry.
* Mostly reactively, when a problem or study target arises.
* Learn by doing - having a problem and solving for it.
* mimicking, I will often take code someone else has written and adapt it.

## What I struggle with
* no clear direction, I find it easier to work towards a specific, measurable goal.
* repeating manual tasks
* learning new coding languages.
* distractions, I'm easily distracted.

## Things that I love
* my family
* working flexibly to spend as much time around my young family as possible (before they grow up and realise how embarrassing I am)
* playing and watching sports, coffee, New Zealand
* tech that makes my life easier.

## Things that annoy me
* repeating manual tasks
* lack of direction or vision.
